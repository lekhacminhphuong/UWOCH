### Problem Solving
- The web app helps UW students, who are researching about on-campus housing, figure out their suitable options.
- The web app allows users to compare different on-campus housing options by adding options into the compare table.
- The table provides the comparison of Location, Price, Agreement Duration, Room Type, Dining Nearby, and Living Learning Community.


### Web Development
-	Utilized React components to structure the web and React props and state to make a web page interactive.
- Used Firebase hosting to host UWOCH.
