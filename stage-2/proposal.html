    <h1>Apartment Hunting for College Students</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            People who have tried finding a place to live in Seattle knows how stressful
            the process is since demand is a lot greater than supply in terms of housing in Seattle.
            There are a lot of factors that we need to consider when choosing an apartment:
            location, affordability, parking and some personal preferences, etc.
            and that’s why it is hard to find “the one” during apartment hunting.
            Last year, when my freshman year came to an end, everyone around me was desperately
            trying to find an apartment to live in for the next year.
            A lot of friends, including me, did not find a place that we liked and we had no choice
            but to pay way more that we should due to time crunch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Not only finding a place to rent is hard, but also finding someone to take over lease is very
            time-consuming.
            Since most leases are twelve-month leases and a lot of students go home during summer vacation,
            it is common for students to find someone to take over their leases while they’re not around.
            Take me for example, although my case is a little bit different, I had to find someone to
            transfer my lease to this year and it was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.
            I have done a lot of research on where to find someone to take over my lease and no website or app would
            allow me to do so;
            therefore, I had no choice but posting on Facebook. Although I did find someone to take over my lease
            but I did not like the feeling that my place was exposed and everyone could see me posting and the pictures
            that I uploaded.

        <h2>App Description and App Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            Going through all this process by myself makes me wonder if there is a website that can make this process a
            little easier on students like me.
            The users I target for this website will be only limited to students and recent grads since it would create
            a safer environment for them during apartment hunting.
            The website will only include the apartments near UW campus as well.
            It is specifically for college students or recent grads to find their apartments/roommates/someone who is
            willing to take over the lease.
            I think the website would help solve the problem I described earlier because
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>it would create a safer environment for students since it would avoid random people messaging you
                online/asking you for a tour of the apartment.</li>
            <li>it would also take less time for students (and pressure off of the students) who are on a tight
                timeline.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it would be better than just posting on Facebook since it has more privacy to it.
                Some people,
                like myself, do not want to have the pictures of the apartment/contact information visible to everyone
                on Facebook.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>When the users first on the website, they’ll need to sign up an account with their school emails to
                confirm that they are current students or recent grads.
                (When signing in, every user would have to fill out basic information about themselves so other users
                could take as a reference.)
            </li>
            <li>After that, there are three options for them to choose:
                <ul>
                    <li>finding a roommate</li>
                    <li>inding an apartment</li>
                    <li>finding someone to transfer their lease to.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If the users choose “find a roommate,”
                the website will open a page for the users to look for people who are also looking for a roommate.
                Furthermore, they can also message each other via this website and even schedule a meet-up!
            </li>
            <li>If the users choose “finding a apartment,”
                the website would show different listings that are available to move in for the users.
                There will also be different preferences for the users to choose from on the navigation bar
                on the top of the website, such as, pets/no pets, street-parking/parking lot, budget, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the users choose “find someone to take over their lease, the website would lead the users
                to a page that has a list of people who are looking for a place to live in.
            </li>
